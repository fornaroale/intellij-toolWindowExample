# intellij-toolWindowExample
Implementation of ToolWindow in an IntelliJ-IDEA's plugin.

Basic and not definitive code. The ToolWindow can be started in two ways:
- by clicking on Tools Menu -> Show ToolWindow
- by clicking directly on the ToolWindow (bottom-right)

The content of the ToolWindow is a sample of data retrieved by a CSV file. Note that the ToolWindow is forced to be closed when the IDE starts (see plugin.xml).
